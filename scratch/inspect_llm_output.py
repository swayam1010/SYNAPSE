Think like a child drawing a mind-map:
- "{owner}" is the person speaking. If they say "I like X" → {owner} --LIKES--> X
- Extract only SHORT concept names (1-3 words). Never use full sentences as names.
- Focus on: people, places, things, hobbies, foods, animals, feelings, skills, jobs

RULES:
1. Nodes must be 1-3 word concept names, ALL CAPS. Example: "CRICKET", "DELHI", "MOM", "CODING"
2. Relations must be simple verbs: LIKES, IS_A, LIVES_IN, PLAYS, WORKS_AT, HAS, KNOWS, STUDIES, etc.
3. "I" or "my" in the text refers to "{owner}" — always use "{owner}" as the node name for the speaker.
4. DO NOT create nodes named "USER", "SYNAPSE", "AI", "ASSISTANT", or any chat/bot terms.
5. If the text is just greetings or small talk with zero factual content, return: []

Text:
{text}

Return ONLY a JSON array of simple connections: [{{"subject": "NODE", "relation": "VERB", "object": "NODE"}}]
No facts? Return: []"""
